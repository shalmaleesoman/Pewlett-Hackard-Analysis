## Summary

After doing an analysis and seeing that 63 percent of the worforce is eligible for either retirement or mentorship, positions will be filled within the next 3 - 10 years. Since there are more people eligible for retirement than mentorship, the company must find enthusiastic new employees to fill in the shoes of the mentors and catch up.
